    ACTIVEX CONTROL DLL : [!output PROJECT_NAME] Project Overview
========================================================================

ControlWizard has created this project for your [!output PROJECT_NAME] ActiveX Control
DLL, which contains 1 control.

This skeleton project not only demonstrates the basics of writing an
ActiveX Control, but is also a starting point for writing the specific
features of your control.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files
that make up your [!output PROJECT_NAME] ActiveX Control DLL.

    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an
    Application Wizard. It contains information about the version of
    Visual C++ that generated the file, and information about the platforms,
    configurations, and project features selected with the Application Wizard.

    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

    This is the main include file for the ActiveX Control DLL.  It
    includes other project-specific includes such as resource.h.

    This is the main source file that contains code for DLL initialization,
    termination and other bookkeeping.

    This is a listing of the Microsoft Windows resources that the project
    uses.  This file can be directly edited with the Visual C++ resource
    editor.

    This file contains information about the ActiveX Control DLL that
    must be provided to run with Microsoft Windows.

    This file contains the Object Description Language source code for the
    type library of your control.

    This file contains an icon that will appear in the About box.  This icon
    is included by the main resource file [!output PROJECT_NAME].rc.

Other standard files:

stdafx.h, stdafx.cpp

    named [!output PROJECT_NAME].pch and a precompiled types (PCT) file named stdafx.obj.

resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    The Visual C++ resource editor reads and updates this file.
